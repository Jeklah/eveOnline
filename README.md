# Ship Cost Calculator  

**Requirements**  
Python 3.7

Run the following command to install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Using the Tool**  
Run the script by running the following command

`python scripts/ships.py`

python executable name may rely on your version installed.
If python does not work, the following are worth trying:

`python3`

**For the Future**
Please make an issue on what ship people would most like to see added next so I can keep track. 
Just add your name to an open ship issue to vote, to avoid duplicate ship threads.
I plan on adding research time into this, how deep would everyone like me to go? 
Please create issues on what else you would like to see done.

Enjoy
