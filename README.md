# Ship Cost Calculator  

**Requirements**  
[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)  
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

**Installation**  
Run the following commands to clone the git repository and move into the repo directory

`git clone https://github.com/Jeklah/shipCostCalc.git`  
`cd shipCostCalc/`

Run the following command to install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Using the Tool**  
Run the script by running the following command from the shipCostCalc folder.
You could also run it directly from the scripts folder using `python3 ships.py`.

`python3 scripts/ships.py`

**Notes**   
`python3` and `pip` executable name may rely on your version installed.
If `python3`/`pip` does not work, the following are worth trying:

`pip3`  
`pip3.7`  
`pip3.8`  
`python3.7`  
`python3.8`

**For the Future**  
Please make an issue on what ship people would most like to see added next using 
the [templates](https://github.com/Jeklah/shipCostCalc/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) in the .github folder and make an issue on [the issue page](https://github.com/Jeklah/shipCostCalc/issues) using it so I can keep track of what's most wanted.   
Just add your name to an open ship issue to vote, to avoid duplicate ship threads.    
I plan on adding research time into this, how deep would everyone like me to go? Add your name to the issue I will create along with
any comments regarding this.
Please create issues on what else you would like to see done.  

Also, if anyone finds any problems, please create an issue :D and tag it with 'Bug' please. Thanks.

Enjoy
